# Non-Linear-Hint-System
This is a small system that I created for a horror game. Flawed, will be improved in the long-term.

This system is meant to create hints without destorying the ones that existing. Hints can be displayed repeatedly. 
Current version is still flawed and require improvements. However it does the job for my current project. 
In time I'll adjust this system.
